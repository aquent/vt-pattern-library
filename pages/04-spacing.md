## Shared Responsive Grid System

The Aquent & Vitamin T Grid System base is set by an increment of 5. The gutter is set first, and the margin is 2x the gutter width. For example, when the gutter is set to 15px, the margin is 30px. 

### Desktop

On desktop, there are two grid choices.

![Grid layout]({{ '/img/grid-desktop-flex.svg' | path }})

### Tablet and Mobile

Tablet &amp; Mobile leverage the ‘Flex Grid’ because the screen sizes will be more controlled.

![Grid layout]({{ '/img/grid-tablet-mobile-flex.svg' | path }})

### Mobile

The ‘Flex Grid’ gutters and margins become smaller to allow for an optimal use of screen space, but still employs the same principles.

![Grid layout]({{ '/img/grid-mobile-flex.svg' | path }})

## Horizontal Spacing

Horizontal Spacing is also set by an increments of 5 to correlate with original grid foundation. WIP. For reference only. Design to use when designing comps. Dev to implement based on comps.

![Horizontal spacing]({{ '/img/spacing-horizontal.svg' | path }})

## Vertical Spacing

*To-do: Import detailed vertical spacing breakdown from Figma*

### Large Breakpoint

![Vertical spacing, large breakpoint]({{ '/img/spacing-vertical-large.svg' | path }})

### Medium Breakpoint

![Vertical spacing, medium breakpoint]({{ '/img/spacing-vertical-medium.svg' | path }})

### Small Breakpoint

![Vertical spacing, small breakpoint]({{ '/img/spacing-vertical-small.svg' | path }})
